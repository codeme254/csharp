# Control Flow Statements

Control flow statements are the statements that alter the flow of program execution and provide better control to the
programmer on the flow of execution.

A program executes from top to bottom except when we use control statements.

We can control the order of execution of the program, based on logic and values.

## Types of Control Flow Statements
Control flow statements are divided into the following categories:
- Selection Statements or Branching Statements: (Examples: if-else, switch case, nested if-else, if-else ladder)
- Iteration Statements or Looping Statements: (Examples: while loop, do-while loop, for-loop, and foreach loop)
- Jumping Statements: (Examples: break, continue, return, goto)

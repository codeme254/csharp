# Advantages and Disadvantages of Arrays

## Advantages of Arrays
1. It is used to store similar types of multiple data items using a single name.
2. We can use arrays to implement other data structures such as linked lists, trees, graphs, stacks, queues, etc.
3. The two-dimensional arrays in C# are used to represent matrices.
4. The Arrays in C# are strongly typed. That means they are used to store similar types of multiple data 
items using a single name.

## Disadvantages of Arrays
1. The array size is fixed. So, we should know in advance how many elements are going to be stored in the array. 
Once the array is created, then we can never increase or decrease the size of an array. If you want then we can 
do it manually by creating a new array and copying the old array elements into the new array but this is not very
practical.
2. As the array size is fixed, if we allocate more memory than the requirement then the extra memory will be
wasted. On the other hand, if we allocate less memory than the requirement, then it will create a problem.
3. We can never insert an element into the middle of an array. It is also not possible to delete or remove 
elements from the middle of an array.
